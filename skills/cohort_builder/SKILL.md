# HistAI Pathology Datahub API

## Description

This skill provides secure access to the HistAI Datahub, allowing you to search for pathology cases, filter by clinical and technical criteria, buy cohorts, and export whole slide images (WSI) and metadata. This API is designed for building research cohorts and managing data access.

---

## Authentication

All requests require an API Key.

```bash
export HISTAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Include the key in the `X-API-KEY` header:
```
X-API-KEY: $HISTAI_API_KEY
```

Users can generate API keys at **Profile and settings → API keys** on [https://celldx.hist.ai](https://celldx.hist.ai).

## Billing Endpoints

#### POST `/v1/billing/topup/charge`
Instant top-up of credits.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amountUsd": 1000
}
```

---

## Export Endpoints

### 1. Case Search & Discovery

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cases`
List cases. Supports pagination parameters: `page` (default 0) and `size` (default 100).

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cases/search?page=0&size=20`
Search for cases using complex filters. Pagination is handled via query parameters `page` and `size`.

**Request Body (Filters):**
```json
{
  "organ": ["Breast"],
  "isCancer": true,
  "stainName": ["H&E"],
  "ageRange": [40, 60]
}
```

#### 🔍 Search Strategy: Handling Localization
When a user asks for a diagnosis that includes an organ name (e.g., **"Prostate adenocarcinoma"**), be aware that the `primaryDiagnosis` field might only contain the morphology (e.g., **"Adenocarcinoma"**) while the localization is stored in the `organ` or `organSystem` fields.

**Organ Variability:**
The `organ` filter can contain both specific and general terms (e.g., **"Left ovary"**, **"Right ovary"**, **"Ovary"**, and **"Ovaries"**). 

**Best Practices:**
1.  **Explore First**: Always use `/v1/datahub/cases/filters` or `/v1/datahub/cases/filters/page` to see the actual values and counts for the `organ` and `primaryDiagnosis` fields.
2.  **Breadth Selection**: Select **all relevant values** from the filter results that fit the query. Do not just pick the first match (e.g., select both "Left ovary" and "Ovary" to get all results).
3.  **Split Queries**: If an initial search for a full compound name returns few results, split the query (Morphology + Organ). Filter by `organ` (e.g., "Prostate") or `organSystem` (e.g., "Genitourinary") and combine with a broader search in `primaryDiagnosis`.

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cases/filters`
Get available filter values (facets) and counts matching the current criteria.

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cases/filters/page`
Paginate through large lists of filter values (e.g., list all primary diagnoses matching "carcinoma").

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cases/filters/global`
Retrieve global, unfiltered lists of available filter options (e.g., all organs in the system).

---

### 2. Cohort Management

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts`
List all your cohorts.

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cohorts`
Create a new cohort.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "My Breast Cancer Cohort",
  "cases": [
    { "caseId": "case_123" },
    { "caseId": "case_456", "slideIds": ["slide_A", "slide_B"] }
  ]
}
```
**Constraints:**
- `name`: Max 200 chars, cannot be blank.
- `cases`: Must not be empty. No duplicate case IDs.
- `slideIds`: Optional. If omitted, **all slides** in the case are included/purchased. If provided, **only** the specified slides are included. Use this to reduce costs by purchasing only relevant stains (e.g., specific IHCs).

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}`
Get details for a specific cohort.

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/status`
Check the status of a cohort (`PENDING`, `BUILDING`, `PAID`, `UNPAID`, `FAILED`).

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/slides`
Add slides/cases to an existing cohort.

**Request Body:**
```json
[
  { "caseId": "case_789" }
]
```

#### DELETE `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/slides`
Remove slides/cases from a cohort.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cohort Modification Rules**
> Cohorts can only be modified (adding or removing slides) while their status is `UNPAID`. Once a cohort is `PAID`, it is locked and cannot be changed.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Financial Risk & Mandatory Confirmation**
> Purchasing a cohort involves real financial transactions and is non-refundable once the status is `PAID`. 
> **AI Agents MUST explicitly confirm the total cost and cohort content with the user and receive a clear "YES" or "PROCEED" before calling this endpoint.**
> Never assume the user wants to pay based on high-level instructions alone.

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/pay`
Pay for a cohort to enable export. This endpoint is idempotent and requires an `Idempotency-Key` header.

**Headers:**
```
X-API-KEY: $HISTAI_API_KEY
Idempotency-Key: <unique-uuid>
```

---

### 3. Data Export

Export is available only for `PAID` cohorts.

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/export/status`
Check if the export package is ready (`PREPARING`, `READY`, `EXPIRED`, `FAILED`).

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/export/manifest`
Get the download URLs for the cohort manifest and metadata.

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/export/files`
List available files for download in the cohort.

#### GET `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/export/files/{fileId}`
Get a signed download URL for a specific file (WSI).

#### POST `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{cohortId}/export/refresh`
Refresh expired download tokens/links.

---

### 4. Billing

#### GET `/v1/billing/balance`
Get current account balance and currency.

#### GET `/v1/billing/history`
Get transaction history.

#### GET `/v1/billing/payment-methods`

#### POST `/v1/billing/topup/charge`
Add funds to account.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amountUsd": 100
}
```

## Pricing & Volume Discounts

Use the following table to estimate cohort costs in advance. Pricing is per slide and depends on the stain type and total quantity within a single cohort.

| Quantity | H&E Slides | Other Slides (IHC, etc.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1–99 | $5.00 | $40.00 |
| 100–999 | $4.00 | $32.00 |
| 1000–9999 | $3.00 | $27.00 |
| 10000+ | $2.00 | $23.00 |

> [!TIP]
> **Volume Discounts**: Discounts are calculated based on the total number of slides **per cohort**. To maximize savings, we recommend purchasing as many slides as possible within a single cohort rather than creating multiple smaller cohorts.

## Workflow Guide

1.  **Explore**: Use `/v1/datahub/cases/filters/global` or `/v1/datahub/cases/filters` to analyze available options (diagnoses, stains, organs etc). **Always do this first** to ensure you use the exact spelling and terms present in the dataset (e.g., checking if it is "Invasive ductal carcinoma" or "Carcinoma, Ductal, Invasive").
2.  **Search**: Use `/v1/datahub/cases/search` to find cases meeting your research criteria (e.g., specific diagnosis + IHC markers).
3.  **Filter**: Use filters to refine your selection until you have the desired set of cases.
4.  **Create Cohort**: Use `/v1/datahub/cohorts` to save these cases as a named cohort.
    *   **Tip**: To save costs, specify `slideIds` in the request to purchase only relevant slides (e.g., only the HER2 slides found in search) rather than the entire case.
5.  **Pay**: Use `/v1/datahub/cohorts/{id}/pay` to purchase the cohort data.
6.  **Export**:
    *   Poll `/export/status` until `READY`.
    *   Get the manifest via `/export/manifest` to inspect the file list.
    *   Download individual WSIs using `/export/files/{fileId}` or use the bulk archive URL from the manifest if available.
